GC05_5,"For evidence that more gun control laws do not reduce gun murder, one need only look at state-level gun control, which has not shown success at reducing firearm death rates.  The conclusion must be that more gun control laws do not reduce gun murder."
GC05_5,"Gun laws at the state level have never been proven to reduce crimes, so perhaps gun control laws don't work to reduce murder."
GC05_5,Gun control laws don't reduce gun murder because most states have gun control laws and they have not proven to reduce the firearm death rate.
GC05_5,"Because most state-level laws do not reduce the firearm death rate, more gun control laws will not reduce gun murder."
GC05_5,"Most state-level gun control laws do not reduce the firearm death rate, so enacting more gun control laws will do nothing to reduce it."
GC05_5,The firearm death rate is not reduced by gun control laws.
