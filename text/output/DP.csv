DP04_2,6,"Nothing deters criminals more than the fear of death, because people in general fear nothing more than death. This is why the death penalty has the beneficial effect of deterring crime. Therefore, the death penalty is a must."
DP04_2,7,The death penalty would be a reasonable means to deter crime is in fact people considered the consequences before their actions rather than acted impulsively.
DP04_2,8,The death penalty is a deterrant to crime and so we should continue allowing it.
DP04_2,9,The death penalty is necessary because its use deters crime.
DP04_2,10,"Because people fear nothing more than death, it will deter criminals from committing crime. Therefore, we should support the death penalty."
DP04_2,11,The death penalty should be used to deter a criminal by fear of death.
DP04_2,12,The death penalty is necessary to deter crime using the fear of death as deterrent
DP04_2,13,The death penalty is necessary because it deters crime based on people's fear of death more than anything else.
DP04_2,14,We need the death penalty because it deters crime because people fear nothing more than death and nothing will deter a criminal more than the fear of death
DP04_2,15,"Since people fear nothing more than death, nothing will stop criminals more. Hence, the death penalty is needed."
DP04_2,16,We should accept the death penalty because nothing will deter a criminal more than the fear of death.
DP04_3,1,"People fear the death penalty, so crime is reduced as no one wants to get sentenced to death."
DP04_3,2,The death penalty is needed because it deters crime.
DP04_3,3,The death penalty will make the world a better place by deterring crime.
DP04_3,4,The death penalty is obligatory as mode to deter crime which is advantageous.
DP04_3,5,The death penalty serves as a benefit to society in that it is a means to deter crime. Therefore the death penalty is a valid and needed option.
DP04_3,6,"Some of the most violent criminals can only be deterred from committing crimes by the threat of death, nobody wants violent crime which is why the death penalty is an essential institution."
DP04_3,7,We should continue using the death penalty because it deters crime.
DP04_3,8,We should use the death penalty because it deters crime.
DP04_3,9,We need the death penalty because it is a way to deter crime.
DP04_3,10,We should keep the death penalty because it deters crime.
DP04_3,11,The Death penalty is it effective way of determining crime
DP04_3,12,"We need the death penalty, because it will deter crime."
DP04_3,13,"We should have the death penalty, because it deters crime."
DP04_3,14,We need the death penalty to deter crime
DP04_3,15,Since the death penalty is a way to deter crime the death penalty is a needed resource.
DP04_4,1,The death penalty deters crime because recent credible investigations have found introducing the death penalty correlates with a murder rate.
DP04_4,2,"Recent reliable investigations indicate that the introduction of the death penalty correlates with a murder rate.  Therefore, the death penalty deters crime."
DP04_4,3,The need to introduce the death penalty should correlate with the observed murder rate according to recent well-researched investigations.   The conclusion is that the death penalty deters crime.
DP04_4,4,"The death penalty deters violent crime and makes society safer. Evidence from around the world has shown that the death penalty has no unique deterrent effect on crime.Far from making society safer, the death penalty has been shown to have a brutalizing effect on society."
DP04_4,5,Recent crime rates going down in conjunction with the death penalty as a possible consequence proves the death penalty deters crime.
DP04_4,6,We should use the death penalty because it decreases murders.
DP04_4,7,The death penalty deters crime by correlating with the murder rate.
DP04_4,8,The death penalty correlates with the murder rate so it deters crime.
DP04_4,9,"Recent investigations state that introducing the death penalty correlates with murder rates, this helps deter crime."
DP04_4,10,"The death penalty deters crime, because recent credible investigations claim that the death penalty correlates with murder rate."
DP04_4,11,The death penalty deters crime because it correlates with murder rate
DP04_4,12,"The death penalty isn't always an option when it comes to crime, it is mainly brought into effect when there is a high murder rate which then it shows to lower the murder rate."
DP04_4,13,We should support the death penalty because it deters crime.
DP04_5,1,Although recent studies assert that the death penalty deters crime these studies are not credible because they contain numerous technical and conceptual errors and therefore the death penalty does not deter crime.
DP04_5,2,"The death penalty does not deter crime, and recent studies that indicate otherwise are not reliable because they contain numerous technical and conceptual errors."
DP04_5,3,Recent studies claim that the death penalty deter crime which is implausible  because the studies may contain numerous technical and conceptual errors.
DP04_5,4,There should not be a death penalty becasue there is no credible evidence that it deters crime.
DP04_5,5,"Though recent studies assert that the death penalty deters crime, these studies are rife with technical and conceptual errors. It can therefore be concluded that the death penalty does not deter crime."
DP04_5,6,Without credible sources and studies you're unable to determine statistically if the death penalty reduces crime.
DP04_5,7,The studies about death penalty as a deterrant are flawed and cannot prove the death penalty deters crime.
DP04_5,8,"Studies state that they death penalty deters crime, but they are not credible so it really doesn't deter crime."
DP04_5,9,Recent studies asserting that the death penalty deters crime are not credible.
DP04_5,10,"The death penalty does not deter crime, although many sources state otherwise, these sources are not entirely credible as they are filled with technical and conceptual errors."
DP04_5,11,The data has errors so the death penalty does not deter crime
DP04_5,12,There are too many numerous technical and conceptual errors within recent studies to argue that the death penalty deters crime.
DP04_5,13,"According to some non-credible studies, the death penalty deters crime."
DP04_5,14,"Recent studies wrongly assert that the death penalty deters crime, and they contain numerous technical and conceptual errors."
DP04_5,15,The death penalty does not deter crime because the studies showing that it does contain numerous technical and conceptual errors
DP04_5,16,"Even though there are studies that the death penalty deters crime these studies are not credible since they contain many numerous, technical and conceptual errors, thus the death penalty does not deter crime."
DP04_5,17,We should do away with the penalty because it does not deter crime.
DP04_6,1,"The death penalty does not deter crime because criminologists, who are knowledgeable about the subject, claim that the death penalty does not deter crime."
DP04_6,2,Criminologists do not believe the death penalty deters crime.
DP04_6,3,Criminologists who study the topic agree that the death penalty does not deter crime.
DP04_6,4,The death penalty does not hinder crime as criminologists claim so too.
DP04_6,5,"Crime is beyond man understanding as to why some human go to the extend killing, with regards to this the death penalty does not deter crime committed by this person."
DP04_6,6,"Criminologists as a group are familiar with the topic of crime, and they largely assert that the death penalty does not deter it.  It can be concluded, therefore, that the death penalty does not deter crime."
DP04_6,7,The death penalty should not be adopted because criminologists have shown that it is not effective at deterring crime.
DP04_6,8,"According to criminologists, the death penalty doesn't prevent crime from occurring. Therefore, the death penalty is not necessary to ensure the deterrence of crime."
DP04_6,9,"If even criminologists don't think the death penalty deters crime, it's pretty safe to assume the death penalty is not a crime deterrant."
DP04_6,10,"As asserted by criminologists, the death penalty does not deter crime."
DP04_6,11,"Criminologsts who are familiar with the effects of the death penalty on crime assert that the death penalty does not deter crime.  Therefore we can conclude, based on expert opinion, that the death penalty does not deter crime."
DP04_6,12,Experienced criminologists have shown that death penalty does not deter a crime.
DP04_6,13,The death penalty does not deter crime according to reputable criminologists.
DP04_6,14,Criminologists say that the death penalty does not deter crime so it should not be allowed.
DP04_6,15,Criminologists have not been able to prove that the death penalty deters crime.
DP04_6,16,Criminologists agree that the death penalty does not deter the crime
DP04_6,17,Criminologists agree that the death penalty does not deter crime.
DP04_6,18,The death penalty does not deter crime because criminologists say so
DP04_6,19,We should ban the death penalty because it does not deter crime.
DP05_1,1,A punishment in proportion to a crime is a key property of retributive justice and the death penalty is a punishment in proportion to a serious crime. Therefore the death penalty is retributive justice (not vengeance).
DP05_1,2,The death penalty is a key part of retributive justice because it responds to the severity of the crime.
DP05_1,3,"The death penalty is retributive justice, not vengeance, because it provides a punishment proportional to serious crime."
DP05_1,4,The death penalty is a punishment in proportion to a serious crime which is a key to property of retributive justice.
DP05_1,5,"That a punishment be deemed to be proportionate to the crime committed is a key property of retributive justice, as opposed to vengeful justice. The death penalty can be deemed a proportionate crime in the case of certain highly serious crimes. The death penalty is a sentence that accords with retributive rather than vengeful justice."
DP05_1,6,The death penalty is a proportional punishment and so we can see it as retributive justice.
DP05_1,7,We should use the death penalty because it is a key part of retributive justice.
DP05_1,8,"The death penalty does not appease the victims base desires, nay it is simply equalizing the evil a person has cast into nature."
DP05_1,9,"Because the death penalty is a punishment in proportion to a serious crime, we should consider it retributive justice."
DP05_1,10,The death penalty is retributive justice because it is a punishment in proportion to a serious crime.
DP05_1,11,The death penalty gives equal justice for the crime they have committed.
DP05_1,12,The death penalty is retributive justice because it is punishment for a serious crime.
DP05_1,13,"Since the death penalty is proportional to the crimes committed to get it, it is retributive justice."
DP05_1,14,"The death penalty is retributive justice(not vengeance), because it is a punishment for serious crimes."
DP05_1,15,"The death penalty is not vengeance but retributive justice, because it is a punishment in proportion to a serious crime."
DP05_1,16,The death penalty is retributive justice because the death penalty is a punishment in proportion to a serious crime and a punishment in proportion to a crime is a key property of retributive justice.
DP05_1,17,"As a criminal not only harms people with their crimes but society as whole, retribitutive justice is needed. The death penalty does not fall under this circumstance."
DP05_1,18,The death penalty is retributive justice it is a punishment in proportion to a serious crime.
DP06_1,1,The death penalty is not permissible because the criminal justice system must be fair and the death penalty is racially biased.
DP06_1,2,"Because of the racial bias present in the administration of the death penalty, it should be abolished."
DP06_1,3,The death penalty's racial bias makes it unfair.
DP06_1,4,"As justice must be fair regardless of race, the death penalty is applied unequally, according to racial bias, is therefore unjust."
DP06_1,5,The death penalty is racially biased thus the criminal justice system ought to act in all fairness.
DP06_1,6,I can clearly conclude that the death penalty is not okay because of the percentage  of african americans that are effected by it.
DP06_1,7,"Because the death penalty is racially biased, it does not follow the mandate of the criminal justice system to be fair and impartial.  Therefore the death penalty is not okay."
DP06_1,8,The death penalty is bad because it contains a racially biased component and thus cannot be just or fair.
DP06_1,9,We shouldn't use the death penalty because it is racially biased and therefore is not fair.
DP06_1,10,The racially biased death penalty is not acceptable.
DP06_1,11,The death penalty is racially biased.
DP06_1,12,The death penalty is unacceptable because of the racial bias in the criminal justice system. The death penalty does not follow a fair criminal justice system because of its racial bias.
DP06_1,13,The death penalty does not provide enough margin of error to prevent the death of innocents due to inherent human bias.
DP06_1,14,"There should be no death penalty, because the criminal system is unfair."
DP06_1,15,The death penalty is racially biased and therefore should not be used in the criminal justice system.
DP06_1,16,We shouldn't have the death penalty because it is racially biased and the criminal justice system should be fair.
DP06_1,17,"The death penalty has been shown to be racially baised, in a criminal justice system that must be fair the death penalty does not follow this as racial biases do not allow for a fair system."
DP06_1,18,We should not accept the death penalty because the criminal justice system is racially biased.
DP06_2,1,The death penalty is racially biased as a greater number of one race is executed far more frequently than the average population demographic.
DP06_2,2,The death penalty is racially biased because it is disproportionately applied to certain racial groups.
DP06_2,3,The death penalty is racially biased which induces the death sentence of a particular race becoming higher as compared to the population.
DP06_2,4,The death penalty is racially biased because the death sentence rate of a particular race is high compared to the general population.
DP06_2,5,"Currently, the death sentence rate of a particular race is high as compared to the overall imprisoned population. This bears out the assumption that if the death penalty is racially biased then the death sentence rate of a particular race will be seen as high compared to the overall imprisoned population. Based on current statistics, the death penalty is indeed racially biased."
DP06_2,6,The death penalty has a racially biased component we can identify through which race is disproportionately sentenced to the death penalty.
DP06_2,7,The death penalty is racially biased because the death sentence of a particular race is high compared to the population.
DP06_2,8,The death penalty is higher among a particular race.
DP06_2,9,"The death penalty is racially biased, because the death sentence of a particular race is high compared to the population."
DP06_2,10,"The death penalty is racially biased, because the death sentence rate of a particular race is high compared to the population."
DP06_2,11,The death penalty is racially biased because the death sentence rate of a particular race is high compared to the population as a whole.
DP06_2,12,The death penalty is racially biased because the death sentence rate of a particular race is high compared to the population
DP06_2,13,The death penelty has been shown to have an increased rate of occurance among people of a certain race.
DP06_2,14,The death penalty is racially biased because it kills more minoirites than others
DP06_2,15,The death penalty  is racially biased compared to the population.
DP06_2,16,The death penalty is racially biased because the death sentence rate of a particular race will become high compared to the population.
DP06_3,1,The death penalty is not racially biased because it is based on poverty and crime rates.
DP06_3,2,"Though death sentences are disproportionately applied to some racial groups, this does not indicate racial bias because the high poverty and crime rates of particular races are also contributing factors."
DP06_3,3,Poverty is to blame for the high death sentence rate of a particular race compared to the population.
DP06_3,4,Some may claim that the high death sentence rate of a particular race compared to the population is caused by the racially biased death penalty which is not true as the high poverty rate leads to the high crime rate hence the death sentence of the race.
DP06_3,5,"While theorists propose that the high death sentence rate of a particular race compared to the overall population is caused by the racially biased death penalty, there are other factors that  affect the high death rate of the disadvantaged group. For example, the high poverty rate of the race in question leads to a higher crime rate among the disadvantaged group, which in turn leads to a higher death sentence rate than that of the overall population. It can therefore be concluded that the death penalty is not racially biased."
DP06_3,6,"The Death Penalty Information Center has released a major new report on race and the U.S. death penalty, providing an in-depth look at the historical role race has played in the death penalty and detailing the pervasive impact racial discrimination continues to have throughout every stage of a death penalty case today"
DP06_3,7,"The death penalty is not necessarily racially biased. It is just such that higher poverty and higher crime rates typically go hand in hand, and poverty rates are higher in minority communities."
DP06_3,8,There is no racial bias in the death penalty because the death penalty is much more closely linked to poverty than to race itself.
DP06_3,9,High poverty rate leads to high crime rate which can be more frequent in a certain race but does not mean the death penalty is racially biased.
DP06_3,10,High poverty rates relate to crime so the death penalty is not racially biased
DP06_3,11,The death penalty rate is in more accordance to the high poverty rate of particular races than any notable racial bias.
DP06_3,12,"The death penalty isn't racially biased,, because the poverty rate increases high rate of crime and death sentences."
DP06_3,13,"The death penalty is not racially biased. Although there is a high death sentence rate of a particular race compared to the population, this is not because of the death penalty but rather the high poverty rate of that particular race."
DP06_3,14,The death penalty is not racially biased because race is correlated with higher poverty and higher poverty is correlated with a higher death sentence rate.
DP07_1,1,The death penalty should be avoided because it leads to the killing of innocent people due to mistakes made by the criminal justice system.
DP07_1,2,"The criminal justice system, rather than the death penalty, should be blamed for innocent people being killed."
DP07_1,3,The death penalty is intolerable as it fuels killing innocent people which is inappropriate as the criminal justice may make a mistake.
DP07_1,4,"Since the criminal justice system is not infallible and may sanction the killing of innocent people, it is important to abolish the death penalty"
DP07_1,5,"Although killing innocent people is never the goal of the death penalty it can lead to such a case, because the criminal justice system can make a mistake. Therefore, the death penalty should not be the standard."
DP07_1,6,"The criminal justice system may make a mistake, leading to the death of an innocent person. Therefore, the death penalty should not be adopted."
DP07_1,7,The death penalty is a bad thing because it may lead to the deaths of innocent people.
DP07_1,8,the death penalty should not be an option due to the chance of killing innocent people with any mistake performed by the criminal justice system
DP07_1,9,"The death penalty is not okay, because the criminal justice system may make a mistake and kill innocent people."
DP07_1,10,We don't need the death penalty because it can kill innocent people because the criminal justice system may make a mistake
DP07_1,11,Since the criminal justice system can make a mistake and killing innocent people is a bad thing the death penalty is not needed.
DP07_2,1,The death penalty has the undesirable effect of leading to killing innocent people due to prosecutorial misconduct and is therefore not acceptable.
DP07_2,2,The death penalty should be abolished because it leads to the killing of innocent people due to prosecutorial misconduct.
DP07_2,3,The death penalty is intolerable as it induces killing of innocent people due to prosecutorial misconduct which is dispensable.
DP07_2,4,"Prosecutorial misconduct can lead to a death penalty verdict and the unwanted killing of an innocent person. For this reason, the death penalty is not okay."
DP07_2,5,Doesn't the death penalty prevent crime? Not according to the research. There is no credible evidence that the death penalty deters crime more effectively than a prison term.
DP07_2,6,"There is no 100% definite way to prove the case that someone desreves to die. The rish of killing someone innocent is too great and has happened before. Even if someone did something that is bad enough to deserve it, more thank likely death is too easy. They should live life in prision living with what they did."
DP07_2,7,The death penalty is a bad idea because prosecutorial misconduct can lead to the conviction and killing of innocent people.
DP07_2,8,"We shouldn't have the death penalty because it leads to killing innocent people, which  we shouldn't do."
DP07_2,9,The death penalty shouldn't exist because it leads to the killing of innocent people.
DP07_2,10,We should not have the death penalty because innocent people may be killed because of prosecutorial misconduct.
DP07_2,11,"Innocent people have been killed by the death penalty due to prosecutorial misconduct, as such the death penalty is a bad idea."
DP07_3,1,The death penalty should be abolished because it results in the irreversible and irreparable killing of innocent people.
DP07_3,2,Ending the death penalty would save innocent people.
DP07_3,3,The death penalty is intolerable because it induces killing of innocent people which is an act that cannot be undone.
DP07_3,4,"Use of the death penalty may lead to the irreversible and irreparable consequence of killing innocent people.  therefore, the choice of using the death penalty is not a tolerable one."
DP07_3,5,The death penalty should be done away with because it might lead to the deaths of innocent people.
DP07_3,6,Innocent people have been executed for crimes they did not commit.
DP07_3,7,Innocent people could be killed by death penalty and should be eliminated from the system.
DP07_3,8,The death penalty might kill innocent people so it is not acceptable.
DP07_3,9,"We should not have the death penalty, because it may end up killing innocent people, which is irreversible and irreparable."
DP07_3,10,"The death penalty should be abolished because it may lead to killing innocent people, an irreversible and irreparable action."
DP07_3,11,"We should not allow the death penalty because it may end up killing innocent people, which is irreversible and irreparable."
DP07_3,12,"The death penalty has in the past killed innocent people, the loss of innocent life is irriplaceable as such the death penalty is not allowable because it could take innocent lives."
DP07_4,1,People on death row have been found innocent in the past thanks to DNA testing. The criminal justice system is making a mistake by keeping the death penalty around.
DP07_4,2,"The death penalty causes the death of innocent people, as is seen by the exonerations of innocent people due to DNA testing."
DP07_4,3,DNA testing can be used to show when the criminal justice system makes a mistakes and can prevent innocent people from being killed.
DP07_4,4,The death penalty induces killing innocent people as the criminal justice system makes a mistake as some on death row were found to be innocent due to DNA testing.
DP07_4,5,"Since some death row prisoners were shown by DNA testing to be innocent of their presumed crimes, it means that the criminal justice system is able to make a mistake. We can only conclude that the death penalty leads to killing innocent people."
DP07_4,6,"Some people on death row were wrongfully convicted because of new evidence in light of DNA testing. Thus, if the criminal justice system can mistakenly place an innocent person on death row."
DP07_4,7,Mistakes in DNA testing suggest that there may be innocent people being killed on Death Row
DP07_4,8,The death penalty should be overturned so that no more wrongfully convicted people are executed.
DP07_4,9,The Justice system is not an infallible entity and because of DNA testing it seems that it has been sending people to death row who are innocent.
DP07_4,10,The death penalty could accidentally cause killing of innocent people because some on death row were found to be innocent due to DNA testing.
DP07_4,11,"Unfortunately, some on death row were found to be innocent due to DNA testing, this proves that the criminal justice system can make mistakes and such the death penalty leads to the deaths of innocent people."
DP07_5,1,"Death row has individuals who are proven innocent thanks to DNA testing, so there should be many checks to make sure the person is truly guilty."
DP07_5,2,"Although some death row inmates were found innocent due to DNA testing, multiple assurances are applied before death sentences are carried out.  This does not represent a failure of the system, and the death penalty does not lead to the deaths of innocents."
DP07_5,3,DNA testing could prevent innocent from being killed.
DP07_5,4,"While some prisoners on death row were found to be innocent due to DNA testing, this merely means that multiple assurances are applied before a death sentence is carried out.  Such does not constitute a failure of the system.  Therefore, it can not be concluded that the death penalty leads to killing innocent people."
DP07_5,5,"Despite the occasional failure of DNA evidence, so many assurances are applied before a death row sentencing that it is unlikely the death penalty leads to the killing of innocent people"
DP07_5,6,We should use the death penalty because safety measures prevent innocent people from being killed.
DP07_5,7,The death penalty does not kill innocent people because there are ways to check to make sure the person is innocent.
DP07_5,8,"Multiple assurances are applied before a death sentence, such as DNA testing. Therefore, the death penalty does not lead to killing innocent people."
DP07_5,9,"The death penalty doesn't kill innocent people, multiple assurances are taken."
DP07_5,10,Innocent people are not killed by death penalty because of the extensive DNA testing performed before the sentencing is completed.
DP07_5,11,There are assurances via DNA so the death penalty does not kill innocent people.
DP07_5,12,multiple assurances are applied before a death sentence to avoid the killing of innocent people
DP07_5,13,The  death penalty doesn't cause innocent people to be killed; it just means there should be multiple assurances.
DP07_5,14,"Innocent people are not killed by the death penalty because some on death row were found to be innocent due to DNA testing, meaning that multiple assurances are applied before a death sentence"
DP07_5,15,"Since some on death row have been found to be innocent due to DNA testing this means that multiple assurances are used before the death sentence is carried out, as such the death penalty does not kill innocent people."
DP07_5,16,We should accept the death penalty because multiple assurances are applied before a death sentence.
DP07_6,1,The death penalty is reasonable because the higher standard in death penalty cases makes it unlikely that innocent people will die.
DP07_6,2,The death penalty is acceptable because the chance of killing innocent people is low since the justice system has a high standard for death penalty cases.
DP07_6,3,"Some claim the death penalty induces killing innocent, although the possibility is very low as the criminal justice system rightfully demands a higher standard for the death penalty cases thus death penalty is inevitable."
DP07_6,4,"The criminal justice system rightfully demands a higher standard for death penalty cases. So, while theorists argue that the death penalty leads to killing innocent people, the possibility is actually very low. Therefore, the death penalty is okay."
DP07_6,5,"Although some will argue that innocent people may be killed when the death penalty is enforced, the possibility of this happening is low, because of the criminal justice system's high standards for these cases."
DP07_6,6,"While some say the death penalty leads to the killing of innocent people, in fact the burden of proof is so high in death penalty cases that the wrong person is rarely convicted."
DP07_6,7,Soicietal rebukes that innoncent lives are slain via the death penatly are unfounded on the strict judical system with it's checks and balances.
DP07_6,8,"The criminal justice system demands a high standard for death penalty cases, so few innocent people are killed. Therefore, the death penalty should be legal."
DP07_6,9,The death penalty is acceptable and safe from executing innocent people by the fact those convicted have numerous appeals that take years. So much so that most sentences are not carried out until decades after the original crime was committed.
DP07_6,10,The very low possibility of innocent people getting killed makes the death penalty acceptable.
DP07_6,11,The criminal justice system demands a higher standard for death penalty cases to avoid the killing of innocent people.
DP07_6,12,"The death penalty is needed, because the criminal justice system demands a higher standard for the death penalty cases."
DP07_6,13,"The death penalty is okay, because the possibility of killing innocent people is very low since the criminal justice system rightfully demands a higher standard for the death penalty cases."
DP07_6,14,The death penalty should be kept because there is a lower risk of killing innocent people because of the higher standard for death penalty cases.
DP07_6,15,While some may argue the death penalty kills the innocent this is a very low possibility as the criminal justice system rightfully demands a higher standard of quality for the death penalty cases.
DP07_6,16,We should accept the death penalty because the criminal justice system rightfully demands a higher standard for the death penalty cases.
DP07_6,17,"Despite what many believe, the death penalty is less likely to lead to killing innocent people because the criminal justice system demands a higher standard for death penalty cases."
DP08_1,1,We should introduce life in prison without parole because the death penalty is too cruel and we need one or the other.
DP08_1,2,Life in prison without parole is an equal punishment to death and therefore should be promoted in place of the death penalty.
DP08_1,3,Introduction of life in prison without parole is required as it is better than the death penalty as it as severe as death penalty.
DP08_1,4,We should introduce life in prison without parole because it is the most severe of the two warranted punishments (life without parole or the death penalty) for certain crimes.
DP08_1,5,"For some crimes. the death penalty or life in prison without parole is necessary. Yet, life in prison without parole is as severe as the death penalty, therefore preferable. We should therefore introduce a sentence of life in prison without parole."
DP08_1,6,Life in prison without parole should be seen as a viable alternative to the death penalty because the punishment is just as severe.
DP08_1,7,Life in prison without parole is okay because it's just as bad as the death penalty.
DP08_1,8,We should introduce life in prison without parole because it is as severe as the death penalty.
DP08_1,9,We should introduce life in prison without parole because it is better than the death penalty.
DP08_1,10,Life in prison is the same as the death penalty so it should be introduced
DP08_1,11,"Life in prison should be considered an alternative to the death penalty, being equally severe."
DP08_1,12,"We should introduce life in prison without parole, because life in prison without parole is better than the death penalty."
