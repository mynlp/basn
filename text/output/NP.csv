NP04_1,Nuclear power plants should be built and operated because they provide carbonless energy.
NP04_1,Nuclear power plants provide carbonless energy and are needed
NP04_1,Nuclear power plants are imperative as a way to provide carbonless energy which is advisable.
NP04_1,"Data shows that carbonless energy is the way to go for our future, and nuclear power plants are a way to provide that carbonless energy.  Therefore, nuclear power plants are a necessity."
NP04_1,Nuclear power plants are needed to avoid further reliance on carbon-producing energy sources.
NP04_1,"Nuclear power plants are a requirement, because they provide the carbonless energy."
NP04_1,"Nuclear power plants are the best energy sources because they don't emit carbon, therefore are clean, good energy sources."
NP04_1,Nuclear power plants are important because they are a way to provide carbonless energy.
NP04_1,Nuclear power plants are necessary in providing carbonless energy.
NP04_1,We need nuclean power plants to get carbonless energy.
NP04_1,Nuclear power plants provide energy that is carbonless.
NP04_1,"Nulear power plants are necessary, because they provide desirable carbonless energy."
NP04_1,"We need nuclear power plants, because they provide carbonless energy."
NP04_1,We need nuclear power plants to provide carbonless energy
NP04_1,Nuclear powerplants are needed as they are a mean to provide energy without the byproduct of carbon which harms the enviroment
NP04_1,We need nuclear power plants because they provide carbonless energy
NP04_1,Nuclear power plant is important because it provides carbonless energy .
NP04_2,"Although nuclear power plants may provide carbonless energy, they are not needed because other energy forms such as wind, solar, and geothermal also serve this role."
NP04_2,Nuclear power plants are not the safest way to provide carbonless energy.
NP04_2,"It's been credibly argued that nuclear power plants are a means to provide carbonless energy. Yet, it's also true that renewable forms of energy, such as wind, solar and geothermal power, are also viable sources of carbonless energy.  Therefore nuclear power plants are not explicitly required sources of power for our future."
NP04_2,Nuclear power plants are not critical in that we have other ways of producing carbonless energy such as wind and solar.
NP04_2,We should not use nuclear power plants because safe renewable alternatives exist.
NP04_2,We don't need nuclear power plants because there are safer means to get renewable energy.
NP04_2,"Nuclear power plants are not the only means of providing carbonless energy, there are safer renewable forms such as wind, solar, and geothermal power."
NP04_2,"Nuclear power plants are not necessary because there are other forms of safe, carbonless energy."
NP04_2,There are other clean ways of getting energy such as wind and solar so nuclear power plants are not necessary.
NP04_2,"We don't need nuclear power plants as a way to provide carbonless energy, because we have safe renewable forms of energy such as wind, solar, and geothermal power that provide carbonless energy."
NP04_2,"While it is argued that nuclear power is a means to provide carbonless energy however, there is also wind, solar and geothermal power are also options ot provide the same carbonless energy."
NP04_2,"Renewable forms of energy such as wind, solar, and geothermal power are safer than nuclear power plants and also provide carbonless energy."
NP04_2,"We should make nuclear power plants unnecessary because safe renewable forms of energy such as wind, solar, and geothermal powers also provide carbonless energy."
