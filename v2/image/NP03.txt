[variables]
Case ONP: to operate nuclear power plants
Case DOE: to despoil our environment with long-lived radioactive materials
Case ICR: to increase cancer risk
Proposition NIC: To operate nuclear power plants increases cancer risk.
Proposition RRT: The radiation from a reactor is tiny: about as much as that from our own bodies.
Case MME: mining, milling, and enriching uranium for fuel to create nuclear energy
Case RSA: to release significant amounts of radiation into the air and water
Case UMI: uranium mining
Case SHP: serious health problems to uranium miners
Case PEQ: to produce enormous quantities of radioactive waste
Concept SPR: a serious problem
Proposition PIS: To produce enormous quantities of radioactive waste is a serious problem.
Proposition CPP: There currently is no permanent repository for the waste.
Case OCP: to operate a coal-fired power plant
Proposition NBC: To operate nuclear power plants is better than to operate a coal-fired power plant.
Proposition RNR: Risks from nuclear reactor accidents are much less than those from air pollution caused by coal burning.
