NP03_6,15,We should accept a nuclear power plant because risks from nuclear reactor accidents are much less than those from air pollution caused by coal burning.
NP03_6,16,A nuclear power plant is necessary because power is necessary and nuclear power is cleaner for the environment than coal power

NP04_1,17,We need nuclear power plants to provide carbonless energy
NP04_1,18,Nuclear powerplants are needed as they are a mean to provide energy without the byproduct of carbon which harms the enviroment
NP04_1,19,We need nuclear power plants because they provide carbonless energy
NP04_1,20,Nuclear power plant is important because it provides carbonless energy .
NP04_2,1,"Although nuclear power plants may provide carbonless energy, they are not needed because other energy forms such as wind, solar, and geothermal also serve this role."
NP04_2,2,Nuclear power plants are not the safest way to provide carbonless energy.
NP04_2,3,"It's been credibly argued that nuclear power plants are a means to provide carbonless energy. Yet, it's also true that renewable forms of energy, such as wind, solar and geothermal power, are also viable sources of carbonless energy.  Therefore nuclear power plants are not explicitly required sources of power for our future."
NP04_2,4,Nuclear power plants are not critical in that we have other ways of producing carbonless energy such as wind and solar.
NP04_2,5,We should not use nuclear power plants because safe renewable alternatives exist.
