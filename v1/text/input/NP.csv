NP01_1,"After more than a half-century of commercial nuclear energy production in the United States, there have been no radiation-related health effects linked to their operation.
The above is evidence that nuclear power is safe.",Nuclear power is safe.
NP01_2,"The U.S. nuclear power industry has not melted down a reactor since Three Mile Island.
The above is, however, not evidence that nuclear power is safe.",Nuclear power is not safe.
NP01_3,"The lives of people in Japan are being endangered by nuclear radiation as a result of the breakdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant.
The above is an example that shows nuclear power is not safe.",Nuclear power is not safe.
NP02_1,"Regulating the uses of nuclear energy is a means to make nuclear power safe.
The action is enough to achieve the goal as nuclear plants are designed, licensed, constructed, and operated to rigorous requirements established by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission.",Nuclear power is safe.
NP02_2,"Regulating the uses of nuclear energy is a means to make nuclear power safe.
The action is enough to achieve the goal as the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has a continuing inspection and oversight process with on-site resident inspectors and periodic inspection teams to ensure compliance with regulations and associated programs.",Nuclear power is safe.
NP02_3,"Regulating the uses of nuclear energy is a means to make nuclear power safe.
The action is not enough to achieve the goal as the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission does not adequately enforce safety standards.",Nuclear power is not safe.
NP02_4,"Safety systems are means to make nuclear power safe.
The action is enough to achieve the goal as modern nuclear technologies have multi-layered safety systems in place that offer a huge improvement on the older power plants.",Nuclear power is safe.
NP02_5,"Safety systems are means to make nuclear power safe.
The action is enough to achieve the goal as hundreds of systems monitor, control, and support the safe operation of the reactor at each power plant.",Nuclear power is safe.
NP03_1,"Nuclear power plants despoil our environment with long-lived radioactive materials.
It is not desirable to despoil our environment with long-lived radioactive materials.",Nuclear power plants are not acceptable.
NP03_2,"Some may argue nuclear power plants increase cancer risk.
It is not true because the radiation from a reactor is tiny: about as much as that from our own bodies.",Nuclear power plants are acceptable.
NP03_3,"Operating nuclear power plants requires mining, milling, and enriching uranium for fuel to create nuclear energy.
Mining, milling, and enriching uranium lead to releasing significant amounts of radiation into the air and water.
It is not desirable to release significant amounts of radiation into the air and water.",We should not operate nuclear power plants.
NP03_4,"Operating nuclear power plants requires uranium mining.
Uranium mining causes serious health problems to uranium miners.
Causing serious health problems to uranium miners is not desirable.",We should not operate nuclear power plants.
NP03_5,"Operating nuclear power plants produce enormous quantities of radioactive waste.
Producing enormous quantities of radioactive waste is a serious problem because there currently is no permanent repository for the waste.",We should not operate nuclear power plants.
NP03_6,"Either a nuclear power plant or a coal-fired power plant is necessary.
A nuclear power plant is better than a coal-fired power plant because risks from nuclear reactor accidents are much less than those from air pollution caused by coal burning.",A nuclear power plant is necessary.
NP04_1,"Nuclear power plants are means to provide carbonless energy.
Providing carbonless energy is desirable.",Nuclear power plants are necessary.
NP04_2,"Some may argue nuclear power plants are means to provide carbonless energy.
Safe renewable forms of energy such as wind, solar, and geothermal power are also means to provide carbonless energy.",Nuclear power plants are not necessary.
